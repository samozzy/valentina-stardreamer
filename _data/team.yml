    about: |
      Haste Theatre is a multilingual, physical theatre partnership of 4 female identifying artists. With a focus on celebrating the liveness of performance and a physical complicite amongst an ensemble, our work celebrates the ephemerality of theatre and bodies together in a room. We pull together a myriad of styles and influences that best serve the stories we tell in order to create joyful, unique experiences.
